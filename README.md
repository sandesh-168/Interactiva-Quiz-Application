DESCRIPTION:

Project Overview: JavaScript-Based Interactive Quiz Application
This project is a dynamic and interactive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of the application is to provide users with an engaging way to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. With features such as instant feedback, explanations for answers, randomized question sets, and score tracking, the application delivers a complete quiz experience suitable for learning, practicing, or just having fun.

Key Features
    Interactive Quiz Interface: The application offers an intuitive user interface that guides users through each step of the quiz process. From starting the quiz to answering questions and viewing results, the UI is designed to be simple yet visually engaging.

   Multiple-Choice Questions: Each question comes with a set of options, allowing users to select one answer from multiple choices. The options are randomized each time to reduce pattern recognition and encourage genuine understanding.

   Instant Feedback and Explanations: Upon selecting an answer, users receive immediate feedback indicating whether their choice was correct or incorrect. Additionally, a short explanation is provided to help users understand the reasoning behind the correct answer, reinforcing learning.

   Progress Tracking: A built-in progress bar or question counter informs users of their position in the quiz, making it easier to keep track of how many questions remain.

   Score Calculation: The application keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz. At the end, it displays the total number of correct answers along with the percentage score, allowing users to assess their performance.

   Randomized Questions and Answers: To ensure a unique experience each time, both the questions and their respective answer choices are shuffled. This feature also helps prevent memorization based on order.

   Responsive Design: The quiz application is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. Whether used on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface remains accessible and user-friendly.

   HTML: Provides the structural foundation of the application, including the layout and interactive elements.

   CSS: Handles the visual styling, animations, and responsive layout to ensure a pleasant user experience.

   JavaScript: Powers the core logic of the quiz, such as loading questions, evaluating answers, tracking score, and managing quiz flow.

Project Structure
